A privacy-first browser extension that autofills job application forms using your local profile data. **Zero server calls, zero tracking** - everything happens in your browser.

## üéØ Why Local-First?

In this era of AI and software, **Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is more important than ever**. Traditional job autofill tools send your data to remote servers, creating unnecessary privacy risks and potential data breaches.

**Local-First** means:
- ‚úÖ Your profile data never leaves your device
- ‚úÖ No server calls, no tracking, no data collection
- ‚úÖ Works offline and respects your privacy
- ‚úÖ Easy setup with just a JSON file

## ‚ú® Features

- **Local Profile Storage** - Store multiple profiles in IndexedDB (encrypted optional)
- **ATS Support** - Works with Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, Ashby, and more
- **Smart Field Detection** - Automatically detects and maps form fields

### Privacy-First Features

- **On-Focus Suggestions** - Get contextual suggestions as you fill forms
- **Review Panel** - Preview changes before applying, with undo capability
