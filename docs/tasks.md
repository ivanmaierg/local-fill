## üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance

### Test Infrastructure Setup
- [x] Create HTML fixtures for ATS platforms testing
- [ ] Set up Playwright E2E testing with extension support
- [ ] Implement unit tests for core modules
- [ ] Add performance timing budget tests

### Testing Tasks
- [ ] Unit tests: schema validation, rules engine, transformers
- [ ] Integration tests: autofill flows, DOM handling
- [ ] E2E tests: full user workflows across ATS platforms
- [ ] Accessibility tests: keyboard navigation, screen readers
- [ ] Performance tests: timing budgets, memory usage

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components

### Core Modules (`packages/lib/`)
- [x] `profile.schema.ts` - Zod validation schemas
- [ ] `rules.engine.ts` - Field mapping and rule resolution
- [ ] `dom.scan.ts` - DOM analysis and candidate extraction
- [ ] `fill.run.ts` - Autofill execution and event dispatching
- [ ] `suggest.ts` - Suggestion ranking and snippet generation
- [x] `storage.ts` - IndexedDB and chrome.storage wrappers

### UI Components (`packages/ui/`)
- [ ] `ReviewDrawer.tsx` - Review panel with editing capabilities
- [ ] `SuggestionsPopover.tsx` - On-focus suggestion UI
- [x] `CopyPromptButton.tsx` - LLM prompt copying functionality
- [x] `ProfileManager.tsx` - Profile switching and management
- [ ] `RulesEditor.tsx` - User rules customization interface

### Extension Pages (`apps/extension/`)
- [x] `background.ts` - Service worker for rule engine and messaging
- [x] `content.ts` - Content script for DOM interaction and UI
- [x] `options/main.tsx` - React options page for settings
- [x] `overlay/main.tsx` - Overlay UI components

## üîß Development Environment

### Build & Development Tools
- [x] Configure TypeScript with strict settings
- [x] Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- [x] Configure TailwindCSS with design tokens
- [x] Set up development server with hot reloading
- [x] Add build optimization and source maps

### CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- [ ] Build verification and linting
- [ ] Playwright browser testing in CI
- [ ] Extension packaging and validation

## üìä Success Metrics (Implementation)

### Performance Targets
- [ ] Autofill execution < 1s (p75 percentile)
- [ ] Suggestion popover display < 150ms (p75 percentile)
- [ ] ‚â•90% success rate on seed ATS platforms

### Quality Gates
- [ ] All unit tests passing (>80% coverage)
- [ ] All E2E tests passing
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Performance budgets met
- [ ] No console errors in production builds

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Start with M0** - Get the basic scaffold working
2. **Focus on M1** - Profile management is foundational
3. **Build M2** - Core autofill is the main feature
4. **Test incrementally** - Use fixtures for each ATS platform
5. **Polish at the end** - M6 brings everything together

## üìù Notes

- **Privacy-first**: Ensure no network calls except when explicitly enabled
- **Local storage**: All user data stays in IndexedDB/chrome.storage
- **ATS compatibility**: Start with Greenhouse/Lever, expand to Workday/Ashby
- **Testing**: Use real ATS page structures in fixtures for accurate testing
- **Accessibility**: Implement keyboard navigation and ARIA labels throughout

This task list provides a comprehensive roadmap for building the job autofill extension. Each task is designed to be independently testable and deliverable.
